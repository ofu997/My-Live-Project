## My-Live-Project

The purpose of this live project was to store and organize media files for The Tech Academy's podcasts using MVC architecture and C#. I was able to design a user interface and add pagination features for the files. One can search entries by name, sort them by name and date, and perform the CRUD functions. [The current deployed webpage.](https://www.learncodinganywhere.com/Podcasts) Below are some pictures of the project.

*Directions:* **Clone** *this repository. In* **Visual Studio** *'s menu, select "File", "Open", "Project/Solution", then find "PodcastFilesAndFolders", and select* **Podcast.sln** *.Run the solution. To add a new entry, select the yellow link "Create New", enter a Youtube.com video URL, then remove everything except the video ID. For example, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxuK1OSerY becomes 0AxuK1OSerY. Sorting and search by speaker abilities are also available.*
