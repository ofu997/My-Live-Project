## My-Live-Project

The purpose of this live project was to store and organize media files for The Tech Academy's podcasts using MVC architecture and C#. I was able to design a user interface and add pagination features for the files. One can search entries by name, sort them by name and date, and perform the CRUD functions. [The current deployed webpage.](https://www.learncodinganywhere.com/Podcasts) Below are some pictures of the project.

*Directions:* **Clone** *this repository. In* **Visual Studio** *, find the* **Podcast.sln** *file in the folder called* **PodcastFilesAndFolders** *and open it on Visual Studio. Finally, run the solution.*
